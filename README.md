# Object-Detection-via-Yolov8
Overview
Welcome to the Team 7 YOLO Object Detection project! This repository contains the code and resources for our object detection system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. Our aim is to provide a robust and efficient solution for detecting objects in images and videos.

Features
Object Detection: Utilizes YOLO for real-time object detection.
Custom Dataset Support: Easily train YOLO on your custom dataset.
Visualization: Tools for visualizing detection results.
Evaluation: Metrics to evaluate the performance of the detection system.

Training YOLO
To train YOLO on your custom dataset, you will need to:

Prepare your dataset:

Ensure your images and annotations are in the correct format.
Update the configuration files to point to your dataset.
Run the training script:

sh
Copy code
python train.py --data <data-config-file> --cfg <model-config-file> --weights <pretrained-weights-file>
Inference
To run inference on images or videos:

Run the inference script:
sh
Copy code
python detect.py --source <input-file-or-directory> --weights <trained-weights-file>
